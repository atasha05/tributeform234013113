            <h2>Tesla's Revolutionary Timeline</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1856:</strong> Born in Smiljan, Austrian Empire (modern-day Croatia).</li>
                <li><strong>1882:</strong> Conceives the idea for the rotating magnetic field, the principle behind nearly all AC machinery.</li>
                <li><strong>1884:</strong> Arrives in the United States and briefly works for Thomas Edison.</li>
                <li><strong>1888:</strong> Invents the **induction motor** and patents the system for generating, transmitting, and using alternating current. This invention ignites the "War of Currents" against Edison's direct current (DC).</li>
                <li><strong>1891:</strong> Invents the **Tesla coil**, an electrical resonant transformer circuit used to produce high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current.</li>
                <li><strong>1893:</strong> Showcases the power of AC by illuminating the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago with George Westinghouse, a spectacular display known as the "City of Light."</li>
                <li><strong>1895:</strong> The Niagara Falls hydroelectric power plant, using Tesla's AC system, begins operation, delivering long-distance power to Buffalo, New York.</li>
                <li><strong>1899:</strong> Moves to Colorado Springs to conduct high-voltage, high-frequency experiments, including early work on wireless transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>1943:</strong> Dies in New York City, leaving behind a legacy of over 300 patents worldwide.</li>
            </ul>
